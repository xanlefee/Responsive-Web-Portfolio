#A responsive Portfolio of my Web Development Projects


This is a portfolio of my web projects to date, with an about me, work & contact section. 
Users can navigate the portfolio by clicking on the navigation bar and the page will automatically scroll to the desired section.
There are linked to deployed web applications in the work section. There are also links to my CV and links to my various contact methods in the footer.

In the footer there is also a link that when clicked, opens an email form. The application will resize to any container so is suitable for web, mobile and tablet displays.

I had issues with the initial formatting and responsiveness of the page however I persisted, deciding to work with CSS Grids and implement flex elements throughout the CSS.

I chose to use my own artwork as icons to give a more personalised touch. I enjoyed the challenges of this project.
